Java Server Page  -----> JSP

Jsp  is used to create dynamic web applications just like servlet Technology.

JSP is the extension to Servlet..
Because it provide more functionality  such as expression language,JSTL etc

Jsp consists of HTML tags and JSP tags
Easy to maintain than servlet
bcoz we can seperate businees logic and presentation logic in Jsp

Merits:
Faster Development ------> if we done any changes in the code we don't need to recompile and redeploy the project..but in servlet we have to update and recompile if we want to change the look and feel of the websites

Easy to Maintain ----> we can writer html tags and jsp tags seperately


Less code than servlet ----> JSP has implicit object so instead of writting 

SERVLET:
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
out.println("Hello world")

JSP
out.println("Hello world");
Here --> out is an implicit object in jsp ...


Extension to the servlet -----> jsp is the extension to the servlet ,whatever the features present in servlet that can be used in jsp too .additionally jsp have come features such as implicit object,Custom tags,JSTL,Expression language etc


LIFE CYCLE OF JSP:
            Jsp page is converted as servlet
            TRANSLATION AS SERVLET
            servlet is compiled into bytecode
            COMPILATION SERVLET
            class file is loaded into the memory
            LOADED INTO MEMORY
            .class file is generated and servlet object is created
            INSTANTIATION OF SERVLET class
            jspinit() is called only once by web container
            INIITIALIZATION OF SERVLET
            _jspservice()  is called for each request
            REQUEST PREOCESSION--SERVICE METHOD IS INVOKED 
            jspdestroy() is called at the end 
            DESTRUCTION OF SERVLET


SAMPLE DEMO JSP FILE:

<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8"
    pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
