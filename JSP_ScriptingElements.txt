The scripting elements in jsp provides some addition information the jsp page

there are three types of scripting elements:
             scriptlet tag ---    <%   %>
             Expression tag ---   <%=  %>
             Declaration tag ---  <%!  %>


scriptlet tag 
we can write java code inside of this tag
EG:
<%
String name = request.getParameter("name");
//we can assign only variable not methods
out.println("Welcome "+name);
// this  <% is called scriptlet tag 
%>


Expression tag
we can write any statement whatever we write inside of this tag that is directly displayed into the browser
without using of out.println statement
used to write the output stream of the response
mostly used to print the values of variables and methods using expression tag
EG:
<%= "Hey this is expression tag" %>



Declaration tag
used to declare methods and variables
<%! int a=10 %>
<%! int sum(a,b)
  return a+b;
%>
EG:
<%! int a =10; %>


difference between scriptlet and Declaration tag
in scriptlet tag we can declare only variable not methods
we can place scriptlet tag inside of _jspservice() 



in Declaration tag we can declare variable and methods
we cannot place this declaraion tag inside of _jspservice() method
