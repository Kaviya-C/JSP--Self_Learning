Directives tells the web container how to translate the jsp page into the corressponding servlet

three Directives:
         page
         include
         taglib

page   -- <%@page import="java.sql.Connection" %>

above is the example for page Directives
the allowed attribute for page Directives are:
         import     -- as like java import statement
         extends    -- extends the parent class
         info       -- getting servlet information using getServletInfo() 
         buffer      -- used to mention the size in kilobytes by default it is 8KB 
         isThreadSafe  -- servlet and jsp is multithreaded support
         if we want to make thread safe then isThreadSafe make as true then only one thread can able to give request and after sending response other request are allowed 
         isELIgnored     -- by default it it false
         that means expression language is enabled by default if u make as true then u disable the expression language
         pageEncoding        -- this will set the ascii type charset 8 like that
         contentType    -- this is http header how the content should be received (text/html is by default)
         session 
         language  --- by default  it is java
         we can mention any scripting programming language
         errorPage   -- this is used to mention if this error occur navigate to this page that page details we have to given in error page
         isErrorPage   by making this as true then current error page will tells what exact error:
             exception.printStackTrace(response.getWriter())


include Directives
<%@include file="header.html"%>

this will include the content of another resources it may be html jsp or servlet
this is static resources
this will happen at page translation time



taglib Directives

<%@taglib uri="" prefix=""%>

this is used to represent the custom tags
create or find the custom tag
describe them in tag library descriptor
uri --    url address
prefix -- this is shortname or nickname to use this as references
